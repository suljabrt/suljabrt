- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @suljabrt
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded programming, Linux, Real-Time Operating Systems, etc. Low level languages such as C, C++, Assembly, but also Python, are my weapons of choice.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Yocto project, idea of creating my own Linux-based distribution is exciting. I'm still a total newbie though.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me on LinkedIn, search for Haris Suljic.
